<p>This math and computer business is new to me! I studied biology and chemistry as an undergrad and got my M.S. Marine 
Biology here at the College a few years ago. I'm aiming for a graduate degree in data science - I finally realized that I 
really enjoy programming and have some science questions I'm interested in exploring.</p>
<p>I have a lovely wife and two crazy dogs, and I'm going on my 7th year living on James Island which I really love. I look
forwarding to getting to know all of you!<p>
