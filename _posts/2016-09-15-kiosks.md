In an unfortunate reality check for anyone placing a little too much faith in humanity, NYC's installation of free WiFi kiosks around the city has gone awry as a result of unintended and unforeseen inappropriate usage of the web browser. The web browser feature has since been deactivated by the company that produced these kiosks...

I imagine if the developers had considered the use-case of a bored and/or shameless user trying to trying to hog the machine for hours at a time, NYC could have avoided this somewhat depressing misadventure.
