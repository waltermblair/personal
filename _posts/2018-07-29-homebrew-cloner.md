<b>Homebrew Cloner</b>  

Well I've submitted my M.S. thesis and am rolling into my third month at my new job, so it's definitely time for a side project!  

I've been interested in rebooting my homebrew cloner project that I started for 601. The goal of that project was to use build a local lamp app with a minimal front-end, just enough to show basic CRUD operations. I wound up with a database of beer ingredients scraped from the web and a javascript front-end that assembled and stored a homebrew recipe based on the particular commercial beer that the user searched for. I was pretty proud of the work, but I still hate php.  

So there's a lot of room to grow with this project, and here are my goals:  
* React frontend
* Go/MySQL backend
* Follow BDD with cucumber  
* Continuous integration with Jenkins
* Deployment with Docker and docker-compose
* Continual improvement to recipe logic
